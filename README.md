# webide-client-tools

## Description

Tools and flows for developing client-side features and extensions for [SAP Web IDE](https://www.sap.com/germany/developer/topics/sap-webide.html)
based on npm ecosystem and standard OSS packages.

## Features

- **Bundling and Minification** of SAP Web IDE features:

  - Mainly uses [require.js optimizer](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html).

- **Testing**

  - Uses [Karma Test runner](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma).
  - Uses our home-brewed APIs, which allows programmatic access to SAP Web IDE Services (Service Test Framework).

- **Local development server** for static resources:
  - Provides fast feedback loops.
  - Runs the bundled version of your feature locally.
  - Uses the [Connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect) Node.js middleware layer.
  - Uses an "in memory" backend mock.

## Requirements and Compatibility

- A [maintained version](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) of node.js.

## Installation

Run this command:
`npm install @sap-webide/webide-client-tools --save-dev`

## Usage and Documentation

See these examples:

- [Documentation Website](https://sap.github.io/webide-client-tools/web/site/)
- [A feature demonstrating client-tool capabilities](https://github.com/SAP/webide-client-tools/tree/master/example).

## Support

To get support, you can open [**issues**](https://github.com/SAP/webide-client-tools/issues) on Github.

## Known Issues

Full usage of this library requires the webide package as an npm peerDependency.
Specifically for testing and development server flows.
This is **currently** not possible outside SAP's coporate network.
Which means that the client-tools library can (**temporarily**) only be used for bundling flows.
