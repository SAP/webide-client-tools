## Contributing Issues

#### Bug Reports

Please provide a (**simple**) way to reproduce the problem.
A bug that can not be reproduced is less likely be solved.

#### Feature Requests

Please also include the reasoning for the desired feature and not just its description.
Sometimes it is obvious, but other times a few sample use cases or an explanation
can come in handy.

## Contributing bug fixes and new features.

Code contributions are **greatly welcome** and **appreciated**.

Before creating a pull request for larger features please open a related issue
to enable a discussion and ensure alignment with the goals of this project.

## Development Environment

webide-client-tools uses npm tasks for the development flows.
Examine the [package.json][./package] scripts for all the available tasks:

#### Initial Setup

- `yarn install`

#### Type Checking, Code Formatting & Linting

Type checks are done by [combining TypeScript interfaces and JSDocs annotations](https://github.com/bd82/typescript_for_public_apis).
`yarn run type_check`

webide-client-tools uses **prettier** to avoid caring about code formatting...
To format your new code use:
`yarn run format`

For ease of use see prettier's [editor integrations](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html)

Linting is done using ESLint.
`yarn run lint`

#### Testing

webide-client-tools uses several different types of tests to promote high quality.

The most basic ones are the **jest unit tests**, which are also the most relevant ones.

- `yarn run test`

Additionally **integration tests** are used to test webide-client-tools as an end user with the help of **npm link**

- `yarn run test_integration`

#### Running the whole central CI flow locally.

- `yarn run ci_full_flow`

## Releasing new Version

#### Usage

1.  Update the [CHANGELOG.md](./docs/changes/CHANGELOG.md).

    - It must start with the **literal** string: "## X.Y.Z (INSERT_DATE_HERE)"

2.  Update the [BREAKING_CHANGES.md](./docs/changes/BREAKING_CHANGES.md).

3.  Commit and push the modifications from the previous steps.

4.  Ensure a clean git working directory.

5.  Run the release script:
    - `yarn run release [patch|minor|major]`

#### Under the Hood

The release script will:

1.  Update versions and dates in appropiate places.
2.  Commit those changes to the master branch.
3.  Create a git tag for the new version.
4.  Push that tag to the github.com repo.
5.  Pushing the tag will trigger a [deploy to npm](https://circleci.com/docs/1.0/npm-continuous-deployment/) build on circle-ci.
